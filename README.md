# AlphaTrend Indicator

## Overview
The AlphaTrend indicator is a trend analysis tool developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. It calculates the Average True Range (ATR) and Money Flow Index (MFI) to identify potential trend reversals and continuations in the forex market. This ReadMe file provides an overview of the code and its functionality.

## Input Parameters
The indicator accepts the following input parameters:

- ATRPeriod: Period for calculating Average True Range (default value: 14)
- MFIPeriod: Period for calculating Money Flow Index (default value: 14)

## Global Variables
The code utilizes the following global variables:

- atrBuffer: Buffer for storing Average True Range values
- mfiBuffer: Buffer for storing Money Flow Index values

## Initialization
The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the indicator. It sets the indicator buffers and labels.

## Calculation
The `OnCalculate()` function is called for each new tick to calculate the AlphaTrend indicator values. It first calculates the Average True Range and stores the values in the `atrBuffer` array. Then, it calculates the Money Flow Index and stores the values in the `mfiBuffer` array.

After calculating the indicator values, the code performs trend analysis by comparing the current and previous values of ATR and MFI. If the current ATR is greater than the previous ATR and the current MFI is less than the previous MFI, a potential trend reversal is detected. If the current ATR is less than the previous ATR and the current MFI is greater than the previous MFI, a potential trend continuation is detected. Otherwise, no significant signal is detected.

The detected signals are printed to the terminal using the `Print()` function.

## Product Description
The AlphaTrend indicator is a powerful tool for forex trend analysis. It combines the calculations of Average True Range and Money Flow Index to identify potential trend reversals and continuations.
